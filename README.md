# 👋 Hey, I'm Shahid Falah

I'm a self-driven front-end developer based in Halabja 🇮🇶, currently studying Computer Science and working to become a full-stack developer.

I specialize in **React.js** and I'm building real-world projects using **Express.js** and **MySQL**. I care about writing clean, understandable code and creating apps that are both useful and scalable.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js (SPA, routing, context)
- Tailwind CSS, MUI, Lucide
- Figma (for UI design and planning)

### Backend
- Node.js + Express (REST APIs)
- MySQL (manual queries and relational design)
- Auth systems (using encrypted tokens, cookies, and role-based middleware)

### Tools
- Git, GitHub (basic version control)
- Vercel (frontend deployment)
- Planning to learn testing using **Google Test**, **Postman**, or **Jest**

## 🚀 Best Project: Flash Sale Platform

> Built with **React** (frontend), **Express** (planned API layer), and **MySQL** (database).

### Goal:
A clean, scalable system for showing time-limited sales with backend logic.

### What I’ve done:
- Designed frontend logic with component reusability in mind
- Created a plan to separate logic between frontend and API
- Learning to push more logic into MySQL for scalability (e.g. date-based filtering, indexing)

### What I’d improve:
- Switch to **Next.js** for better server-side rendering and routing
- Add middleware + cookies for secure authentication
- Add a testing layer for backend and form inputs

---

## 🔒 Auth & Security Practices

- Using middleware to protect routes (e.g. block users from accessing admin routes)
- Encrypting sessions in cookies (learning best practices for secure storage)
- Role-based access control (e.g. admin vs delivery vs user roles)

---

## 🛠 Projects & Commits

I'm working on improving my GitHub repos:
- Organizing code clearly by `src/`, `api/`, and `public/`
- Improving commit messages and history tracking
- Adding better `README.md` files for project instructions

---

## 📌 Goals

- ✅ Deploy frontend projects using Vercel  
- 🛠 Deploy Express backend (Render or Railway – next step)  
- 🔐 Implement full JWT + session-based authentication  
- 📦 Learn deployment pipelines using Git + CI  
- 🧪 Learn testing basics using Postman or Google Test

- Languages: Kurdish (native), Arabic, English (improving)
- Status: Student 👨‍🎓
- Open to: **onsite or remote jobs (within my country)**
