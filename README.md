# 👋 Hi, I'm Shahid Falah

I'm a front-end developer from Halabja 🇮🇶, passionate about building clean, user-friendly web applications. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Halabja and exploring the full stack by building real-world projects using **React**, **Express**, and **MySQL**.

## 🚀 Skills & Tools

### 💻 Frontend
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **React.js** – with experience in `react-router`, `context API`, and conditional rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** & UI Libraries like **MUI**, **Lucide**
- **Figma** – for designing and translating UI into code

### 🔧 Backend
- **Node.js** + **Express**
- **MySQL** with basic schema design and CRUD
- API routes & middleware (auth, data validation)

### 🌐 Full Stack Projects
- I've been building modern web apps using a custom setup:
  - React on the front end
  - Express.js API for the backend
  - MySQL for the database
- Environment configuration with `.env` files
- File structure following MVC principles

---

## 📚 Currently Learning
- **Prisma** for database ORM
- **Next.js** with authentication
- **Improving my English & Arabic** for better communication in development

---

## 📂 My Code Organization
- I like to organize my projects cleanly:
<pre>
  /src
└── components/
└── context/
└── styles/
/api
└── routes/
└── controllers/
└── models/
└── middleware/
server.js
</pre>

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a complete full-stack app with authentication and real users
- Master database relationships and API security
- Apply for remote junior dev opportunities
